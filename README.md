# DEWithPostGreSQL

Hi Everyone! 
This is my first project in the path to become a data engineer.

Here what we have done is , we have taken 3 CSV files related to wealth account data across world.
Afterwards logical data models have been created at draw.io.
From those data models we have created dataframes using Pandas and Python 
Then we have established a connection locally in PostGreSQL and inserted our tables with data in the database.

Any suggestions are welcome!
Kindly support :)
